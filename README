This is just a simple lisp interpreter that I am working on for fun.
This is to help me figure out what I want to create when I write a Lisp interpreter in assembly for stage0.
It also shows how a trivial garbage collector is implemented using fixed sized allocations.
Everything here should be trivial C code.
